    <h2>Hi, this is my webpage!</h2>

    <p>  This webpage will show my 6th period projects and some facts about me.</p>
    
    <p>  The first thing about me is that I am majoring in Roller Coaster Enginering.</p>
    
  <img src="images/coaster.jpg" width="450" height="250">
  <p> This Rollercoaster is called KRAKEN at SeaWorld Orlando. This is also one of the Coasters I would really like to ride</p>
    
    
    <p> Another thing you learn about me pretty quickly is how much I love the band Skillet.</p>
  
  <a href="https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=youtube+skillet&view=detail&mid=79301084CA26164D7B1579301084CA26164D7B15&FO">And this song is Feel Invincible. One of my favorite songs by them.</a>

  <p>That's just one song by them I love.</p>
